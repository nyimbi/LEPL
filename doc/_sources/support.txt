Support
=======

I am using `Google Code <http://lepl.googlecode.com/>`_ for support
services.  Currently these are:

* A `mailing list / discussion group <http://groups.google.com/group/lepl>`_.

* An `issue tracker <http://code.google.com/p/lepl/issues>`_.

* `Source code <http://code.google.com/p/lepl/source/list>`_ repository (a
  regularly updated clone of the entire tree, but not my main repo).

To ask questions, report bugs, and generally discuss Lepl, please post to the
`group <http://groups.google.com/group/lepl>`_.

Documentation
-------------

The simplest way to view the documentation is via the `web
<http://www.acooke.org/lepl>`_ (contents :ref:`here <contents>`).  However,
you can also install a local copy.  Simply download and unpack the appropriate
files (see :ref:`download`).
